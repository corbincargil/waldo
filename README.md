# Where's Waldo Project

## Description:

This photo-tagging app is based on the game Where's Waldo. Start by selecting an image to play, and search for and select each of the characters for that image. A timer will start once the game begins to track your score. 

Unfinished: Once the game is over, user's will be able to add their name into the input field and save their score to the leaderboards.

## Lessons Learned: 
* Advanced state management of React components to handle the status of the game and changing UI based on user inputs. 
* Apply State and Effect hooks to efficiently handle state between functional components
* Further practice implementing React Router for website navigation with unique URL's
* Simple animations added to the UI using React Spring. 
* Practice planning/organizing folder & component structure for a project with multiple "layers", resulting in clean and easy to understand logic and flow of data
* Practice with basic styling of React components
